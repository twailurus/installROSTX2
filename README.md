# installROSTX2
Install Robot Operating System (ROS) on NVIDIA Jetson TX2

These scripts will install Robot Operating System (ROS) on the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 development kit.

Already Tested on L4T R27.1 & L4T R28.1

<strong>updateRepositories.sh</strong>
This is an optional step. Adds the repositories universe, multiverse, and restricted and then apt-get update. These repositories are in the standard 27.1 install, so probably not needed.

<strong>installROS.sh</strong>
Adds the ROS sources list, sets the keys and then loads ros-kinetic-ros-base. Edit this file to add other ROS packages for your installation. After loading, rosdep is initialized.

<strong>setupCatkinWorkspace.sh</strong>
Usage:

$ ./setupCatkinWorkspace.sh [optionalWorkspaceName]

where optionalWorkspaceName is the name of the workspace to be used. The default workspace name is catkin_ws. This script also sets up some ROS environment variables. Refer to the script for details.

### Notes

The script is based on the Ubuntu ARM install of ROS Kinetic: http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/UbuntuARM
